#####Task1 approach#######
As the count needed from both the tables, I took the union of both the tables (enquiries and txns)with the count of the resprctive numbers.
Then query on this union dataset with the SUM function to get the count at one place.
The final data is inserted into a table named output1 created with the required schema.
